## Note
Making the pawpad was awsome. Always wanted to get into 3d modelling and making something tangable instead of my projects just being a concept. Wasnt execting to take as much time it took to finish the pawpad completly. I learned a lot of Fusion 360 and PCB designing :> looks like Ill be making more of my projects tangible.
